## Research 
Yun Yang is a Research Scientist in the School of Energy Resources at the University of Wyoming and a Guest Scientist in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Her research focuses on understanding and controlling multiscale, multiphysics flow and transport processes in fractured porous media to realize the full potential of subsurface energy recovery and geologic repository applications. Dr. Yang develops an integrated experimental–theoretical framework that combines advanced material characterization with high-pressure, high-temperature gas adsorption and diffusion measurements to resolve how fluids are stored, mobilized, and transported in fractured reservoirs across nanopores within porous geomaterials. Her work bridges pore-scale mechanisms with reservoir-scale behavior, with applications to unconventional oil and gas production, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> geologic storage, water resource utilization, and subsurface waste disposal. Dr. Yang joined the School of Energy Resources as a Research Scientist in September 2025 after completing postdoctoral appointments at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of Calgary. She earned her Ph.D. in Energy and Mineral Engineering from Pennsylvania State University in December 2020. 

## Research Themes

### 1. Unconventional Gas Recovery (Shale Gas and Coalbed Methane)
My research investigates the fundamental mechanisms governing hydrocarbon retention in nanoporous shale and coal matrix, where low recovery factors and sustained low production rates are primarily controlled by matrix diffusion and desorption from tight rock frameworks. I designed and established a high-pressure, high-temperature gas adsorption experimental system with high sensitivity, enabling accurate measurements of very small asorption capacities and difffusion coeffcieints in coal and shale under geologic conditions. 
Using advanced pore characterization techniques, I developed fractal adsorption and diffusion models grounded in gas kinetic theory to predict gas adsorption capacity and diffusion rates directly from pore-structure parameters. These models provide closure relationships that can be explicitly used to represent nanopore heterogeneity in reservoir-scale simulations, leading to improved long-term production predictions and supporting operational strategies to maximize gas production from shale and coal reservoirs. Building on this framework, I further demonstrated that cryogenic fracturing using liquid nitrogen can significantly modify pore structure and enhance hydrocarbon recovery by more than 20%, highlighting a promising pathway to improve ultimate recovery in unconventional gas reservoirs.
