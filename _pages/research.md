## Research 
Yun Yang is a Research Scientist in the School of Energy Resources at the University of Wyoming and a Guest Scientist in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Her research focuses on understanding and controlling multiscale, multiphysics flow and transport processes in fractured porous media to realize the full potential of subsurface energy recovery and geologic repository applications. Dr. Yang develops an integrated experimental–theoretical framework that combines advanced material characterization with high-pressure, high-temperature gas adsorption and diffusion measurements to resolve how fluids are stored, mobilized, and transported in fractured reservoirs across nanopores within porous geomaterials. Her work bridges pore-scale mechanisms with reservoir-scale behavior, with applications to unconventional oil and gas production, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> geologic storage, water resource utilization, and subsurface waste disposal. Dr. Yang joined the School of Energy Resources as a Research Scientist in September 2025 after completing postdoctoral appointments at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of Calgary. She earned her Ph.D. in Energy and Mineral Engineering from Pennsylvania State University in December 2020.
